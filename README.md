# Hi, I'm Rishabh Rao ðŸ‘‹

I am a Fullstack Software Developer. I've been programming since I was 13 years old. I can develop custom kernels and roms for android, build cross platform apps and I regularly build things using languages like Typescript, Go and Rust. I also design secure, fast and responsive websites using React and make fluid mobile apps using React Native.

I am currently working as the Head of Engineering at [codedamn](https://codedamn.com).
